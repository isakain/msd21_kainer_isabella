# A good documentation style

## source code comments
* Comments should not duplicate the code.
* Comments do not excuse unlear code.
* If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.
* Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.
* Explain unidiomatic code in comments.
* Provide links to the original source of copied code.
* Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.
* Add comments when fixing bugs.
* Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.

## git commit messages
* There sould be a line between summary/heading and main text. (A short message can also only have 1 line.)
* The summary/heading should be short (with less than 50 characters).
* The summary/heading starts with a capital letter.
* No . at the end of summary/heading.
* Use imperative mood in summary
* The main text should line break after 72 characters.
* The main text should describe what changed and why it was changed, not how it was changed.
